# OPT-garbage-collection

Solution to a garbage collection problem I made with a fellow student for the optimization course, in C#. This solution uses the simulated annealing algorithm to let the program figure out the most optimal path by itself. It randomly adds new connections to the route and calculates if this improves the existing score. Also includes multithreading for better results.
